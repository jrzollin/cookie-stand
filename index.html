        <h2>Testimonials!</h2>
        <p class="content">I was tricked!  Oh, but I am so glad.  I would never have tried these cookies if I was told beforehand they had salmon in them!  But now I know I love them and I get at least five everyday!    --Bob</p>
        <hr />
        <p class="content">You have to try these!  Really!  I can't get enough!    --Susan</p>
        <hr />
        <p class="content">Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought salmon in a cookie would be good.  Boy was I wrong!  Forget Oreos and Chips A'hoy or whatever @*#^ cookies you are eating now.  These will blow you away!  These certainly are not @#^*!   --Gordon Ramsey</p>
